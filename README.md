# Plotly-assignment

This assignment reads in a massive json datafile on belly button bacteria information/demographic info on the people who were studied. It then uses plotly in the app.jy file to plot the data for each individual, which is possible via dropdown menu on the page. Both a histogram and a bubble plot are used as well as creating many .js functions. The project also displays the demographic information of the individual (without revealing their name) in addition to the plots, which is read in from the samples.json file.
